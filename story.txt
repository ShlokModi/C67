Once there was a monkey who lived in a tree who has a lot of fruits to eat but had no friends to talk and share the fruits with. One day he saw a crocodile on the nearby river and started talking him.
They both became good friends. But the crocodile's wife was annoyed because he spent the whole day with the monkey. So one day his wife said that she wants to eat his friend's heart.
The crocodile said her are you foolish?
Wife replied you have to choose friend or wife. The crocodile chose wife and hereby he was going to give the heart of his friend to her wife.
